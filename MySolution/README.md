Skiing OOP

Plan to have a Person class and Skier and Ticketmaster roles which can buy and sell ticket objects.
Have been using ticket containers such as a Pocker and Inventory to store tickets
Right now I am experimenting with splitting up interfaces that a Person can implement into 
a Greeting, Purchaser, and maybe other interface to adhere to SOLID principles; still experimenting

Probably the big software architecture questions for a setup like this is the best way to 
pass around tickets between people objects and the best way to modify information on ticket
objects as people pass them around between each other into these ticket containers
